<p>My reason being here:bassically is to learn on basics about coding and programming to help me in my future as i'm pursuing  my degree course .</p>
<p>I am looking forward to join JKUAT come late this year or early 2023 .I would like to study on mechatronics engineering.  </p>
<h2>WHY MECHATRONICS</h2>
<P>I chose mechatronics engineering based on the fact that ; we are living in a diversifying world.Secondly ,my main goal in this field is to be able to achieve to make Africa a better place via technology.Despite the main goal in everyone's mind is getting rich and having a soft life;I also put in mind making others people's lives *low life* better particularly in my motherland Kenya.</p>

<h3>CHANGE IMPACTED BY GEARBOX</h3>
<P>I joined gearbox institution knowing almost nothing and i had no idea on coding and everything.But now i can confidently say for the 3 weeks i've been here;they have made me a great person;both socially and academically.The transition is noticable:from ZERO to HERO. I believe that for the remainingtime I'll be here,i will step out of the institution nourished with nothing but perfection and skills.All thanks to gearbox academy management and the students there at large. </P>
